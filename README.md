To get access to the database use the database.sql to get the most recents version of the database

*Fixed the sql script, it wasnt working before. Also found and added the songs,
if you guys want to change any of the songs, thats fine (some songs I picked have multiple different versions)


Hamzah Subhani - Notes for 11/17
We inserted some more values for our tables. i also fixed some errors with my queue tables (open and priority). I can talk about those on Wednesday. The next step should be finishing inserting values for KaroakeFile and Contributed. I did Contributer and I think Morgan is doing Requested Songs tonight.
